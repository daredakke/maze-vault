As the robot Nano, make your way through Facility Gamma and retrieve valuable data for your employers.

Activate the teleporter on each floor to progress. To do this, you will need to press all the buttons in the area.

If you encounter buttons that are out of reach, zap a nearby security robot with nanomachines to control it remotely and have it press it for you.

Good luck and watch your step on your way to the precious data!  

## HOW TO PLAY

- Movement - Arrow keys
- Control/release robot - Z (when facing a robot)
- Reset level - R
- Pause - Escape

Step in front of a robot and it will move in that direction. Once it can't move any further, it will stop and start looking out for you again.

Robots will destroy each other if they collide.  

## ABOUT

Created for the Godot Wild Jam #67, theme parasite with wildcard grid-locked.

This was my first time making a puzzle game as well as something grid-based, so it's been a good learning experience (like learning how hard puzzle design can be). Bugs are a given with something like this but hopefully you don't encounter many.

## KNOWN ISSUES

- Taking control of a robot in front of you will cause them to not move until there is at least one empty space in-between.
- A similar thing happens if a box is in-between a controlled robot and the player.
- Stepping on a teleporter the same time it is activated won't teleport you until you move on to it again.
- Boxes don't break weak floor tiles. Or maybe this is a feature?
